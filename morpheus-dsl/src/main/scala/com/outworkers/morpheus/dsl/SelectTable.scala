 * This wonderfully bloated trait is the one where we provide all select methods and partial select methods.
 * Since partial select methods will return type-safe tuples but Scala cannot correctly infer the type for varargs and pass it along to create an adjacent
 * Tuple, we provide a long series of methods which allow partial selects of up to 22 fields, as that's the maximum number of fields a Scala tuple can have.
 * @tparam Owner The table owning the record.
 * @tparam Record The record type.
