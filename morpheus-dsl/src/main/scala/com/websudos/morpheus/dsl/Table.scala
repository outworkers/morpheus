/**
 * The basic wrapper definition of an SQL table. This will force greedy initialisation of all column object members and provide a way to map
 * the basic DSL table definition into a user defined Scala case class.
 *
 * Greedy object initialisation is done in a thread safe way via a global lock acquired on a singleton case object,
 * preventing race conditions on multiple threads accessing the same table during initialisation.
 *
 * Unlike the Java reflection API, which cannot guarantee any ordering in a compiled bytecode file of object members,
 * the Scala reflection API is capable of extracting objects in the order the user writes them inside a table definition.
 * This is a very important guarantee allowing for consistency throughout the DSL and auto-generating table schemas where order is important.
 *
 * @tparam Owner The Owner type of the table, pointing to the extending class defining a table. Used as follows: class SomeTable extends Table[SomeTable,
 *               SomeRecord]
 * @tparam Record The user defined Scala class, usually a case class, holding a type safe data model definition. This allows for type safe querying of
 *                records, as all select all queries will return an instance of Record.

   * type as well as thread safety when multiple threads are reading columns during synchronisation.
   *
   * The reading of columns doesn't used the same lock acquired by the initialisation of columns to guarantee columns are never read before initialisation
