/**
 * This bit of magic allows all extending sub-classes to implement the "where" and "and" SQL clauses with all the necessary operators,
 * in a type safe way. By providing the third type argument and a custom way to subclass with the predetermined set of arguments, all queries such as UPDATE,
 * DELETE, ALTER and so on can use the same root implementation of clauses and therefore avoid the violation of DRY.
 *
 * The reason why the "clause" and "andClause" methods below are protected is so that extending classes can decide when and how to expose "where" and "and"
 * SQL methods to the DSL user. Used mainly to make queries like "select.where(_.a = b).where(_.c = d)" impossible,
 * or in other words make illegal programming states unrepresentable. There is an awesome book about how to do this in Scala,
 * I will link to it as soon as the book is published.
 *
 * @param table The table owning the record.
 * @param query The root SQL query to start building from.
 * @param rowFunc The function mapping a row to a record.
 * @tparam T The type of the table owning the record.
 * @tparam R The type of the record held in the table.
